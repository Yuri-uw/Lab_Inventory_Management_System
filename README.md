# lab_inventory_sharing_system
A JavaFx application.

Description of this system:
Resource sharing is a common activity among graduate students and laboratories, especially in experimental groups. 
In particular, experiments in biology and chemistry require the use of specialized equipment (e.g. chemical containers, pipettes, incubators, microscopes) and reagents that are expensive to purchase and maintain. Furthermore, reagents (chemicals, drugs, enzymes, etc.) must be used before their expiry date. Typically, graduate students share such resources with each other during the early stages of experimental design (to test various setups, to develop and test new protocols), supply shortages (due to weather, pandemic, etc.) and to prevent unnecessary waste. This activity often takes place in mailing lists, bulletin boards, and on social media. However, a dedicated application for sharing these specialized items is currently not available.
